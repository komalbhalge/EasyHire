# EasyHire
It's an Android app for storing/updating/deleting interviewed candidates profile. It is developed in Kotlin with the use of DataBinding Library.

Here I am using the static data which I stored in Firebase Realtime database in order to mentain the status of the candidate.
The database that I have created on Firebase Console is globally accessible and no authentication needed.
